# ArcGIS Location Platform: An introduction for developers

ArcGIS Location Platform is a geospatial (PaaS) for developers to integrate location capabilities into their apps and business systems.

This demo app uses [ArcGIS Location Platform](https://location.arcgis.com) and [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/) in order to demonstrate the following features:

* Basemap select: choose from navigation, imagery, or your own custom basemap.
* Data hosting with feature service: import a CSV with curated Palm Springs tourist attractions, popup; style each points with unique value renderer.
* Route and directions between two selected points.
* Show/hide traffic layer from the Living Atlas of the World.
* Show elevation at point
* Use the Places service to query for near by places of specific categories.
